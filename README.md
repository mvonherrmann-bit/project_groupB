Timeline: Creating map of restaurants in given area(s)
				  Creating program to point to map given certain criteria
				  Testing programming, fixing bugs
				

Concept: A website that allows you to look for restaurants currently open during the pandemic, what services are being provided, and how they are enforcing COVID regulations. We will filter out information from Twitter and Yelp posts and reviews to obtain information that is most relevant to our website's goal. We will create the necessary map using GIS, and create a program that points to a given location within that map using queries to extract information from Twitter using Twitter's API.


Stakeholders: Residents of Orange County- people looking for dining options within Orange County based on certain criteria (see above in Story).
